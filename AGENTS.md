This project contains an Angular application under the `moovi-recommendator`
folder. The standard Angular tooling is not available in the Codex environment,
so the provided test suite is a simple Node script.

## Running tests

Run the following commands from the repository root:

```bash
cd moovi-recommendator
npm test
```

No package installation is required and the tests should complete quickly.
